Effective project management requires precise coordination of tasks, accurate time tracking, 
and robust productivity monitoring. The Project Tracker application addresses these needs by 
offering a comprehensive web-based solution. Users can input project details and visualize task 
dependencies through dynamic graphs. The application employs topological sorting to 
determine the optimal order of task completion, ensuring efficient workflow management. 
Additionally, it features shortest path analysis to identify the minimum time needed to complete 
specific task sequences and critical path analysis to pinpoint tasks that could delay the project 
if postponed. By tracking the actual time spent on tasks, the application generates detailed 
productivity reports, providing insights into project performance. This tool enhances project 
management efficiency through clear visualization, precise tracking, and detailed analysis, 
facilitating successful project completion
